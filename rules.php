			<h3>Rules:</h3>
			<em>Challenges</em><br/>
			<div class="text">
				Any player can challenge another player to a ranked match. The challenged player is free to decline the challenge UNLESS they are fewer than 30 points above the challenger, in which case, they are forced to accept barring extenuating circumstances. The competitors are required to report the winner, map, characters, and KOs so that data can be accurately input. Failure to provide complete and/or factual data will invalidate the results of the match. Players can force a challenge in this way twice a day and engage in a total of five challenges per day. Any challenges after that will not be counted.<br/><br/>
